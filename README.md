## ‚ùîWhat Does It Do?
In theory, a malicious actor could create a Discord bot designed to mimic legitimate Minecraft services, with the goal of deceiving users into sharing sensitive account details. Such a bot might claim to require a Minecraft username and email address for purposes like account verification, server access, or rewards.

If a user unknowingly provides this information, the attacker could potentially exploit Microsoft‚Äôs authentication system. For example, by initiating a login and requesting an alternative verification method (such as email-based codes), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the victim's account‚Äîif the user unknowingly shares the verification code with the attacker.

This scenario highlights the importance of never sharing authentication codes and being cautious when interacting with unofficial bots or services. Understanding how such tactics could theoretically work is essential for improving personal cybersecurity and developing better anti-phishing defenses.
